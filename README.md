## ðŸš€ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) (latest stable)
- [just](https://github.com/casey/just) command runner: `brew install just`
- [cargo-watch](https://github.com/watchexec/cargo-watch) for development: `cargo install cargo-watch`
- [wasm-bindgen-cli](https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-bindgen) for web builds: `cargo install wasm-bindgen-cli`
- WebAssembly target: `rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown`

### Development Workflow

1. **Start the file watcher** (auto-rebuilds on code changes):
   ```bash
   just watch
   ```

2. **Start the web server** (in another terminal):
   ```bash
   just serve
   ```

3. **Open your browser** to `http://localhost:8000`

4. **Make changes** to your code and refresh the browser to see updates!
